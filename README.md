# Clipboard-Image-Saver
Automatically save an image from your clipboard as a PNG file with the desired name. This script opens a popup when your clipboard has an image that is not saved in the respective folder in your machine, enter the desired filename in the textbox and hit Enter key or click create. Now the PNG image is saved in the same folder. Particularly helpful with the windows screenshot shorcut Windows + Shift + S where the screenshot is moved to the clipboard.
